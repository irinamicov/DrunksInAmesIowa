# Who Is Drunk and When in Ames, Iowa?

## Context: 
Ames, Iowa, USA, is the home of Iowa State University, a land grant university with over 36,000 students. By comparison, the city of Ames, Iowa, itself only has about 65,000 residents. As with any other college town, Ames has had its fair share of alcohol-related incidents. (For example, the VEISHEA riots in 2014.) Looking at some breath alcohol test data from Ames published by the State of Iowa, this analysis explores the connection between the drinking patterns in this city and the riots, among other things.

## Data:

The data file 'breath_alcohol_ames.csv' contains 1,556 readings from breath alcohol tests administered by the Ames and Iowa State University Police Departments from January 2013 to December 2017. The columns in this data set are year, month, day, hour, location, gender, Res1, Res2.

## Project Description:

Using data on breath alcohol tests in Ames, Iowa, collected from the State of Iowa, I use **grouping, summarizing, and visualizing techniques** to answer questions such as "When do breath alcohol tests occur most?"

## A breakdown of the most important questions in the project:

- Who gets more breath alcohol tests: men or women?
- What percent of the breathalyzer tests are above the legal limit?
- Which hours of the day have the most and least breathalyzer tests?
- Which month has the most recorded tests?
- Looking at the weeks of the year, is there a pattern over time?

This project is offered as a guided project on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) and requires **data manipulation, data visualization,** as well as **importing and cleaning data** skills in **Python and pandas**.
